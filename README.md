- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Samu, short for Muhammet Sahin! 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m here to learn and improve my coding skills! 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++,C# and a bit of Python
- ðŸ“« How to reach me Muhammet.Sahin@gmx.net .Just send me an E-Mail if you want to 
      collaborate. I'm open for everything! 
 
Since I am a Computer Science student in Germany I have a lot to learn and also looking
for a job training near Aachen, because it's hard to study with Covid and there are not that
many people who can help you if you have questions and it is always better to learn with
a Senior.
